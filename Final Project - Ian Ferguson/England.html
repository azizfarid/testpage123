	Great Britain, in addition to a number of small islands of which the largest is the Isle of Wight. England is bordered to the north by Scotland and to the west by Wales. It is closer 
	to continental Europe than any other part of mainland Britain, divided from France only by a 33 km (21 mi) sea gap, the English Channel. The 50 km (31 mi) Channel Tunnel, near 
	Folkestone, directly links England to mainland Europe. Much of England consists of rolling hills and plains. The north is generally more mountainous with a chain of mountains, 
	the Pennines, dividing east and west, and the Lake District in the north west, containing the highest mountains in the country. 
	Other upland and hilly areas in the north and Midlands are the Cheviot Hills, the North York Moors, and the Shropshire Hills. While most of the mountains and uplands are in the north, 
	Dartmoor and Exmoor are two upland areas lying in the south west of the country. The approximate dividing line between terrain types is often indicated by the Tees-Exe line. To the south 
	of that line, there are larger areas of flatter land, including East Anglia and the Fens, although hilly areas include the Cotswolds, the Chilterns, and the North and South Downs.
	The largest natural harbour in England is at Poole, on the south-central coast. Some regard it as the second largest harbour in the world, after Sydney, Australia, although this fact 
	is disputed. </b> </p> <hr/> <p style="font-size:14px"> In case you missed it: <a href="mailto:sammy4life9@gmail.com" class="firstpara">Click here</a> to email me, or click the picture! </p>
